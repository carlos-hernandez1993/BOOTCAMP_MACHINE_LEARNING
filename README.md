# Machine Learning Project

Creation of a model that makes predictions of the price of flights. We worked with Linear and Polynomial Regression models, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Ada Boost Regressor, XGBoost and Random Forest Regressor.

The prediction model selected was the Random Forest Regression, with which ticket prices can be predicted depending on the place of origin, destination, airline, month, day and class of the ticket.
